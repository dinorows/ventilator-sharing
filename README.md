# ventilator-sharing
An idea for how to fairly share a national stockpile of ventilators across hospitals in the US

The idea is based on how cities share a pool of bikes. Locations are determined, and then bikes are ferried from locations with surplus to 
locations with more demand.

Ventilators are distributed to preexisting or newly built warehouses at the geographic center of Covid19 hotspots. First by cargo planes,
then by trucks. Hospitals send their ambulances to pick up the ventilators.

Since a patient is hooked up to a ventilator for days or weeks, until they recover from their pneumonia, I believe it makes more sense to
return used (and cleaned) ventilators to the wharehouse to ensure equitable sharing, otherwise shuttling ventilators between hospitals is
a scheme that might fall victim to political and financial power.
